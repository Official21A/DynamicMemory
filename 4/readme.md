# Priority Queue

This is an array that sorts the data ( operations ) based of their value of key.<br />
This is exactlly same as what happens in your system, there is a list of events that will execute based on their piority.<br />
In here we use a max-heap to simulate this operation on a program.<br />
Each time we add a new event it will go at the end of array and will make the changes so the array remains a max heap.<br />
