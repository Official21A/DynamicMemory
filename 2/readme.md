<p>
This data structure is a simple model of hash map, that its hash function generates hashed keys by modding them to 4.<br />
Simple and a basic model of hash maps. <br />
Time complexity and storage is the same as a normal linked list but it will reduce the time to <i> T / 4 </i>, which is the <br />
in order.
