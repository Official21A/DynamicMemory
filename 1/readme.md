# Hash Map

<p>
This data structure works by a hashing function, which recives a key and returns a hashed key. <br />
Based on the hashed key it will add the new node to a slot. <br /><br />
Slots are some gates that have a linkedlist which it stores the nodes, that their hashed key is the same as slot number. <br />
This data structure is very useful and simple work, and the its quality depends on the variouty of hash function outputs.
